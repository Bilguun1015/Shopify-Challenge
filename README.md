## Project Overview

This is a React project for the Shopify challenge. The goal of the project was to build a website that would search `OMDB API` for movies. Users are able to search and nominate up to five movies.

## Tech Stack

React was used with Typescript to display components.
Redux store was used for state management.
LocalStorage was used to save nominations and data persistancy.
To style the components, [React Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) was used.
